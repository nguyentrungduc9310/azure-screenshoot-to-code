# Service Communication Optimization

## Overview

This document describes the advanced service communication optimization features implemented in the API Gateway service. These features provide intelligent inter-service communication with sophisticated monitoring, circuit breaking, service discovery, and connection pooling capabilities.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Advanced Circuit Breaker (`AdvancedCircuitBreaker`)

**Purpose**: Sophisticated circuit breaker with multiple failure modes and adaptive thresholds.

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-failure Mode Detection**: Handles timeout, 5xx errors, connection errors, slow responses, and 4xx errors with different weights
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Automatically adjusts failure thresholds based on historical performance
- **Sliding Window Tracking**: Tracks failures and response times using sliding time windows
- **State Management**: Implements CLOSED, OPEN, and HALF_OPEN states with intelligent transitions
- **Response Time Analysis**: Monitors and analyzes response time patterns including percentiles

**Configuration**:
```python
CircuitBreakerConfig(
    failure_threshold=10,                    # Base failure count threshold
    timeout_seconds=60,                      # Recovery timeout
    half_open_max_calls=3,                   # Max calls in half-open state
    enable_adaptive_threshold=True,          # Enable adaptive thresholds
    slow_response_threshold_ms=5000.0,       # Slow response threshold
    failure_weights={                        # Weighted failure types
        FailureType.TIMEOUT: 2.0,
        FailureType.ERROR_5XX: 1.5,
        FailureType.CONNECTION_ERROR: 2.0,
        FailureType.SLOW_RESPONSE: 1.0,
        FailureType.ERROR_4XX: 0.5
    }
)
```

**Key Methods**:

**Configuration**:
```python
ServiceDiscoveryConfig(
    health_check_interval=30,       # Health check frequency (seconds)
    health_check_timeout=5,         # Health check timeout (seconds)
    failure_threshold=3,            # Failures needed to mark unhealthy
    recovery_threshold=2,           # Successes needed to recover
